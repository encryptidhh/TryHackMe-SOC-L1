## üõ°Ô∏è TryHackMe: SOC Level 1 Projects

Welcome to my SOC Level 1 Projects!
This is a repo that contains guided projects based on TryHackMe's SOC Level 1 Path [(Link here)](https://tryhackme.com/r/path/outline/soclevel1)
I've tried to make each project *roughly* correspond to each module, but if they don't, that's fine - you'll lean similar skills from many differnt angles!

You'll find the following for each project:
- üë®‚Äçüè´ Guided instructions: Step-by-step tutorials to understand the *how* of the work
- üñºÔ∏è Screenshots: Images to get a visual idea of what to do - (a picture *is* worth a thousand words, after all)
